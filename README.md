Lately I had been feeling like no document editor felt right for me. Each one of them had their pros/cons and their unique configurability.  
On April of 2023 I had some assignments. I didn't even think about it, I straight up decided to do it the html way. Everything went smoothly (Or atleast I didn't care about the mess xP). My only problem was exporting to pdf (I would feel uncomfortable handing in an html file). Despite finding a workaround I realized that it would be so cool to have my own customizable document editor. (Something like Notion, but the way I want). So now I am doing this.

- [ ] Add an 'Add Page' button on the bottom menu bar.
- [ ] Add color palletes for bg,text,headings etc. on the bottom menu bar.
- [ ] Add right click menu. Click on parts of the text and edit them with some simple clicks.
- [ ] Add an 'Add Box' button. This will be a draggable input box that can be draged and placed anywhere on your document.(Maybe make it so that it has a 'PIN' button that pins it. The button dissappears when you enter print mode).
